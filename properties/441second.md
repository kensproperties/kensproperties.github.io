Frankly, this is the best neighborhood in Ann Arbor.  It is quiet, temperate and residential, yet proximate to all the commercial, social and educational attractions that make Ann Arbor the best place to live in the USA.

Containing a central elementary school, the Old West Side is a mix of families of all ages, apartments, single family homes and long term residents.

### Outstanding Features

This is a very high quality, antique single family home in an unbeatable location:  Ann Arbor’s Old West Side!  Quality, charm, comfort and energy efficiency make this home a one-of-a-kind lucky find. Residents tend to stay for several years because they are very happy here.

Built in circa 1900, I purchased this house in 1976, my first house. Using my degree in Architecture and Design (University of Michigan, 1971), all repairs, improvements and maintenance have been completed with quality, authenticity to the historic nature of the Victorian era details, comfort, economy and longevity, as primary incentives. 

No detail was left undone. Attention to quality has been shown in every way, from the yard, landscaping and brick patio (real clay brick…not concrete simulated brick), to the darling wood-burning stove in the kitchen.

You have a unique, singular and rare opportunity to live in this true family home, lovingly restored and cared for by the long-term owner/manager. No expense was spared to creatively restore this home, perfect for neighborhood living.

An antique solid walnut wardrobe adorns the front foyer. Perfect as a coat closet. I purchased this wardrobe at a yard sale and had it professionally restored. 

The home is unfurnished, in a professionally clean ready to move-in condition.

This home is not your average “rental.” It has never been subjected to the abuse by immature residents.

I personally lived in this house for twenty-two years. Both of my children began their lives here and attended the local elementary school, located only three blocks away.  They both graduated from The Bach School, Pioneer High School and The University of Michigan.

Here are but a few of the advantages of living in this home. This house must be seen and felt to be appreciated.

### Smoke Free & Pet Free Environment

* No yappy dogs disturbing your tranquility.  I like dogs, yeah.  But I do not like being kept awake at night listening to them bark.  Or have the peace of my home corrupted by them.

### Parking
* Driveway with room for three cars.
* Proprietary, residential street parking. There is residential parking, a unique arrangement in Ann Arbor. You are certain to have a space right in front on the street for a nominal annual user fee.

### Rent
Rent is competitive.   I have routinely heard the following statement, “This is the best house I have seen for the money.”

### Lease
One year minimum lease beginning September 1.  I am motivated to sign multiple year’s lease. Let’s talk.  Discount available for multiple year’s lease.
