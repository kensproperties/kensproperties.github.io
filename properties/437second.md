### The Neighborhood

This is the best neighborhood in Ann Arbor.  It is quiet and
residential, yet proximate to all the commercial, social and
educational attractions that make Ann Arbor the best place to live
in the USA.  (Niche.com, April 17, 2017) The building is on a
quiet, residential street and the building is peaceful, clean and
pleasant.

Second Street is lined with venerable trees, cooling in the summer
and providing a breathtaking color tour of red, orange, yellow and
brown leaves in the fall.

Containing a central elementary school, the OWS is a delightful mix
of families of all ages, apartments, single family homes and long
term residents.


### Outstanding Features

No noisy elevators to wait for crowded with strangers.

There are a total of only four apartments in the building occupied by courteous tenants.

The Old West Side is Ann Arbor’s most desirable location.  Close to downtown, but still quiet with a real sense of neighborhood.

Built in approximately 1900. If you listen closely, you can still hear the grain filled railroad cars rumble through town.

All repairs and improvements have been executed with long-term thinking, with permanent materials and with respect for the historic nature of the building and neighborhood.

Apartments 1, 2 and 3 sport antique, wide board, clear finished maple hardwood floors. You cannot buy this anymore.  It has to be custom made.  Apartment #4 is carpeted with commercial grade carpet.

Great attention has been paid to maintain the historic detail of the building’s interior.

Unfurnished: All apartments are unfurnished and have a move-in ready, old world charm.

Back yard: Well maintained, large, private grassy lawn ideal for relaxing, cooking out or studying.

No noisy, crowded elevators to wait for with strangers.


### Utilities

• HEAT IS FREE!!!  
• Each apartment has its own thermostat that you can control.
• Water is included in the rent.
• All apartments are air-conditioned and have at least one ceiling fan.


### Laundry 

* Clean, modern, well kept coin-operated washer and dryer are available for use in the basement.

* Smoke Free & Pet Free Environment

* No smoking and not pets on the property, including on the front porch and in the yard.  I like animals, don’t get me wrong.  Had a cat since I was two years old.  But, no to this.  Everyone is happier.

### Parking

There is a special residential parking status on the block and on the surrounding blocks. You are certain to have a space right in front of the house, on the street for a nominal annual fee paid to the city.  Please call the city’s parking enforcement department for complete information.

### Rent

The rent is very reasonable, significantly below median, according to Rentometer.com.  Yet all the apartments are way above median in quality, location and comfort!  Please contact me for the current rental rates along with current and future availability.

### Lease

One year minimum lease, although I am motivated to sign a multiple year lease. Let’s talk.  Discount available for multiple year’s lease.
