	* Picnic tables and cook-out grills.
	* Community gardens where you can grow your own vegetables and flowers.

- Who is a medical, law, business, longer term masters or Ph.D. student.

### Outstanding Features

* 6 Parkview Place, due to its condition and location, is perhaps the nicest apartment residence in Ann Arbor and that is a bold statement. You must see it to believe it. Solid quality of 1957 construction plus the pristine condition maintained by an OC landlord who overlooked nothing in terms of condition and maintenance. This is a comfortable place to live. You will never want to leave. Tons of closet space and storage inside each apartment. Spacious lockable storage units in the basement.

* Parkview Place is a private, quiet cul-de sac of only well maintained, homes and courteous residents.

* No noisy elevators to wait for crowded with strangers.

* All apartments are unfurnished.

### Utilities

* HEAT IS FREE!!!  Each apartment has its own modern, digital, programmable thermostat that you can control.
* All apartments are air-conditioned.

### Laundry
Clean, modern, well maintained coin-operated washer and dryer are located in meticulously clean basement.


### Smoke Free & Pet Free Environment
No pets and  no smoking on the entire property.  I like animals, don’t get me wrong.  Had a cat since I was two years old.  But, no to this.  Everyone is happier.

### Parking

There are nine free parking spaces on site.  These parking spaces are kept clear of snow in the winter.

### Rent
Rent is reasonable and way below the median and below the average according to Rentometer.com.  Yet these apartments are way above median in condition, size and location.


### Lease
One year minimum lease beginning September 1.  I am motivated to sign multiple year’s lease. Let’s talk.  Discount available for multiple year’s lease.
