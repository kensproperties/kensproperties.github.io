## Testimonials

> Ken was always responsive and he was always ready to help tenants and resolve issues quickly. He is an honest and trustworthy landlord that cares about his properties. The apartment was perfect and quiet for studying, as well as working virtually. As a woman living alone; I felt safe and it felt like a true home.

> I've rented from Ken for the last 4 years and had an awesome experience. The property, 621 S. Division Street, is really well-maintained and in a fantastic location. The other tenants in the building have all been friendly and considerate. Ken is super easy to get a hold of and when any issues came up, he solved them immediately. If I weren't moving out of state, I would rent from Ken again in an instant.

> Ken has been a great landlord over the last two years I have been here. He was very accommodating from the onset regarding my interest in renting the apartment (while I was looking from afar). He keeps the place up to date in so far as possible and addresses issues rapidly. For example he put in a new cutting block, fridge, and oven/stove before I even moved into the apartment. He’s made updates since including a new LED light in the kitchen. He works with a team to make sure that the tenants needs are met and he is very friendly. I would highly recommend living in Ken’s places. Overall one of the best landlords I’ve had.
